"""Print an allowlist of the boot loader's copy of the Apple device tree (ADT).

m1n1 keeps the ADT in a reserved-memory region with compatible "phram" and label "adt". With the
phram module loaded, Linux shows that region as an MTD device named adt. This tool reads it
through the read-only node /dev/mtdNro, or reads a regular file (tests, offline copies), and
prints only:
  - the nodes under ALLOWED_SUBTREES (GPU, display, PMP, power manager, CPU clusters), and
  - the properties named in LIMITED_NODES of a few other nodes (/, /arm-io, /product, and the
    reg of the memory cache controller and the Neural Engine).
Every other node is left out. Inside the printed nodes it drops every property whose name
contains one of DENIED_NAME_PARTS, and every property whose value contains the value of such a
property anywhere in the ADT. The one exception is the uuid of a firmware processor's nub
(iop-*-nub*, FIRMWARE_UUID_NODES): it names the firmware image the boot loader loaded, which is
the same on every Mac with that firmware, and it is printed when it has the form of a UUID.
Numbers are printed in hex. The last line sums up what was dropped.

With --stage2-log it reads m1n1's log of this boot instead (the reserved-memory region labelled
m1n1_stage2.log, which phram shows as the MTD device of that name), with the same checks, and
prints it as text, leaving out every line that names one of LOG_DENIED_PARTS. With --raw as well
it writes the whole region as it is, byte for byte, except that each such line is overwritten
with x (same length), so a ring's layout is kept.

It never writes: every device and file is opened O_RDONLY. Before it reads a device it checks
that the device is the read-only node of the MTD device named adt, and that this MTD device is
the running device tree's reserved-memory region labelled adt, with the same size. It reads at
most MAX_ADT_BYTES, from a device or a file. The output is built in memory and printed only when
everything succeeded.

Usage:
  aurora-adt-extract.py [PATH]          print the allowlist (as root, for a device)
  aurora-adt-extract.py --check [PATH]  check the device and what it is bound to; read nothing
  aurora-adt-extract.py --stage2-log [--check] [--raw] [PATH]
                                        the same for m1n1's stage 2 log (--raw: all of it)
PATH is /dev/mtdNro or a regular file holding an ADT (or the log). Without PATH: the read-only
node of the MTD device named adt (or m1n1_stage2.log).

Exit status: 0 done, 1 I/O error, 2 usage, 3 refused (not the adt device, or it does not match
its region), 4 not a valid ADT, 5 internal error. Nothing is printed on stdout unless it is 0.
