# Kernel: iconidentify/aurora-linux custom/sep (dbbfb92908ba), aurora-silicon/linux aurora-wip plus the
# Secure Enclave (Touch ID) driver, Thunderbolt (#8), the Apple video
# decoder (#45), the M2 Max (t6021) profile and the consolidated Touch ID
# series (aurora-silicon/linux#69: matching after a reboot on every profile,
# M1 Pro J314s, j293 SPI mode, a scan in progress ended before sleep),
# Thunderbolt displays on M1 and M1 Pro/Max by default, and two displays
# through one dock on every M2 Pro/Max laptop (aurora-silicon/linux#8, with
# #46, #50 and #64), and the MacBook Neo (J700) work from #40, #42,
# #43, #54 and #55, including its Touch ID device tree.
# 11.20 adds Touch ID on the MacBook Air M2 15" (J415, aurora-silicon/linux#152),
# a retry from a fresh sensor registration when the first sensor patch fails at
# boot, battery time estimates that read "no data" instead of 0 (#53), the
# Omarchy boot logo in place of Tux, and aurora-wip through 3bb0a6104a11 (the
# MacBook Neo video decoder, PCIe bring-up and radio drivers, inert elsewhere).
# On a MacBook Neo the script keeps the Neo's own m1n1.
# 11.21 adds Bluetooth recovery for the Broadcom PCIe controllers: a radio
# wedged by an rfkill cycle under heavy traffic is reset on the next open, and
# its calibration and address restored (aurora-silicon/linux#7).
# 11.22 installs the VA-API bridge for the video decoder too, so players use
# the hardware decoder instead of falling back to software, and
# aurora-touchid-setup --help prints its usage instead of starting an enrolment.
# The display manager waits (up to 30 s) for the Apple display driver, so a
# late driver can't leave the built-in screen black, and reloading the Touch ID
# driver on M1 is refused with "reboot to re-attach" instead of hanging.
# 11.23 routes USB-C displays on the M2 Pro/Max MacBook Pros in the order the
# compositor pairs them, so two monitors attached at boot each keep their own
# modes, and describes the Touch ID sensor on every M2 Pro/Max MacBook Pro.
# 11.24 adds Touch ID on the MacBook Pro 14"/16" M1 Max and the MacBook Air 13"
# M2, untested on both. On those boards the script first keeps the boot.bin the
# Mac booted with on the EFI partition and prints how to restore it from macOS.
# 11.25 adds the in-tree Apple Neural Engine driver (aurora-silicon/linux#155),
# switched on for the M1 Max and M2 Max only, and the read-only SEP diagnostics
# under /sys/bus/platform/devices/*.sep/diag/. When omarchy-ane-dkms is
# installed the script says so: its modules take precedence over this kernel's.
# 11.25.1 (installer only, same packages): rebuilding m1n1's stage 2 now keeps
# the rest of /etc/default/update-m1n1, so a MacBook Neo keeps its own M1N1=
# and U_BOOT= instead of being rebuilt from an m1n1 that cannot boot it.
# 11.31 brings up PCIe over Thunderbolt on the M1 Pro/Max and M2 Pro/Max by
# default (iconidentify/aurora-linux#10, Wesley Grimes, with follow-up fixes;
# pcie_apple.tunnel_kernel_init=0 turns it off): USB, Ethernet and audio
# behind Thunderbolt docks and displays now work there as they do on M1. It
# builds the drivers for the Intel Ethernet in Thunderbolt 3 and 4 docks (igb
# and igc), and carries the MacBook Neo's Wi-Fi in the shared kernel
# (iconidentify/aurora-linux#11). On a Neo the radios need that Neo's own
# firmware, calibration and country files, which the script checks for; sleep
# is refused while they are active, and Bluetooth is off by default.
# The Neural Engine now powers off when idle (aurora-silicon/linux#155, Joshua
# Warren), and is switched on for the M1, M1 Pro and M2 Pro as well as the M1
# Max and M2 Max.
# 11.32 carries three Touch ID fixes from Justin Pfister's review
# (aurora-silicon/linux#69): a deleted fingerprint is saved as deleted and no
# longer returns after a reboot; an M2 Pro/Max on system firmware 26.2 or
# earlier uses the 13.5 key store, whose keybag that enclave accepts; and the
# kernel's random-number thread no longer asks the enclave for data while the
# Mac sleeps, which left Touch ID failing after resume on an M2 Pro.
# 11.33 adds --reset-touchid, which starts Touch ID over on a Mac whose
# keybag no longer loads (such an M2 Pro/Max after a macOS update): it moves
# the Touch ID state aside for a new keybag at the next boot. Enrolment
# failures are now logged with their cause, and aurora-touchid-setup verifies
# as root, so it also completes over SSH.
# 11.34 sets the brightness of an Apple Studio Display through DCP
# (iconidentify/aurora-linux#15, Wesley Grimes): brightnessctl -d 'dcp-DP-*',
# and nothing is sent until a level is chosen. On the M1/M2 Pro and Max it
# keeps the Thunderbolt root port's link out of ASPM L1, so unplugging an idle
# dock no longer leaves the port dead until reboot.
# 11.35 lets a Touch ID enrolment take up to 36 captures, enough for the 16 to
# 22 an M2 Pro needs (iconidentify/aurora-linux#17, Justin Pfister), and
# reports one stage per capture, so every accepted touch shows progress.
# 11.36 is one kernel for M1, M2 and M3: on M1 Pro/Max laptops a second
# USB-C or Thunderbolt display gets the HDMI port's pipeline when HDMI is idle,
# and a dock display left waiting lights once a pipeline frees. M3 support is
# experimental and kernel-only (see is_m3).
# 11.109-test (not a release): the M3 Pro display handoff on the 14" J514S.
# Kernel 11.109 takes each Mac's PMP values from the boot loader, and m1n1
# aurora7 passes them (/chosen/asahi,t6030-pmp). For --m3-handoff on a J514S.
# 11.36.1 changes only this script and adds an M3 m1n1: an M3 Pro model whose
# m1n1 display and GPU handoff has been booted (the 16" J516S for now) gets
# m1n1-aurora with it switched on, and the built-in display and GPU work.
# Every other M3 stays kernel-only, and --m3-handoff lets an M3 Pro owner try
# the handoff on a model not yet on the list (see --agent-prompt). M1, M2 and
# the Neo are unchanged.
# 11.37: the unified M1/M2/M3 kernel, now 11.110 (aurora-linux air/t8122). Its
# only device-tree change from 11.36 is the five M3 (T8122) trees; the T8122
# GPU and display nodes stay disabled and the driver fails closed, so without
# an opt-in M3 Air m1n1 (shipped only in the -test channel) an Air is kernel-
# only, exactly as in 11.36. The 16" J516S keeps its display + GPU handoff
# (now m1n1 aurora7, which also passes each Mac's PMP values). --m3-handoff is
# available on the 14" J514S (opt-in, not yet on by default). This release adds
# --m3-report and refuses chips it does not support (SUPPORTED_SOCS; #32).
# 11.38: the same device trees and boot loaders as 11.37. The display driver
# checks each display's modes and attributes before using them and refreshes a
# connector's state before reporting a plug or unplug; the M3 Pro PMP's boot
# settings and startup tables are checked before it starts; the M3 GPU
# settings are per chip; each PCI USB controller reserves only the interrupt it
# uses, leaving interrupts for a dock's other devices. An M3 Air stays kernel-only.
# 12.0: one release and one kernel for every Mac this script supports; the
# 11.1xx test builds end here. On the 16" M3 Pro (J516S) the kernel drives
# external displays on the USB-C and HDMI ports, and its m1n1 also hands over
# the second external display processor. The M3 Type-C PHY changes behind this
# apply to every M3. Other M3 Pros keep the handoff opt-in (--m3-handoff). An
# M3 MacBook Air stays kernel-only unless its owner asks with --m3-handoff for
# m1n1's display handoff with GPU diagnostics (the desktop stays on the boot
# framebuffer). An Air that has an earlier test build's boot loader must ask
# again with --m3-handoff.
# Every Mac that gets an m1n1 from this script now gets the same one,
# m1n1-aurora aurora12: M1 and M2 move to it from aurora3, and the M3s on the
# handoff path from aurora7 and 8.x. Only the switches in /etc/m1n1.conf
# differ between Macs. Each Mac's boot.bin is kept on the EFI partition before
# it is rebuilt, with the steps to put it back.
# The kernel also describes the Air's internal display and GPU configuration,
# both inert for now, and the M2 Max Neural Engine cleans up after a failed
# probe (iconidentify/aurora-linux#37, Joshua Warren). M1, M2 and the Neo
# keep their boot loaders.
# 12.1: on M1 and M2, a direct USB-C display's route follows the display
# pipeline the desktop gives it (iconidentify/aurora-linux#39;
# appledrm.typec_follow_crtc=0 turns it off). Its boot loader and device
# trees are 12.0's.
# 12.2 is 12.1 plus a GPU start experiment for the M3 MacBook Air, off unless
# the Air's owner asks for it. The kernel starts the Air's GPU firmware only
# with asahi.t8122_start=1 on the kernel command line. --m3-gpu-experiment
# (Air only) installs the scripts that arm that for one boot and collect the
# result, with a separate G15G Mesa build in /opt/mesa-m3-g15g; it arms
# nothing itself. Every Mac moves to m1n1-aurora aurora12.1: aurora12 plus a
# stand-in power model for the Air's GPU handoff, which stays off unless
# /etc/m1n1.conf has both chosen.asahi,t8122-gpu=1 and
# chosen.asahi,t8122-gpu-power-standin=1. This script writes neither line.
# Without them every Mac boots as it did with aurora12 (12.0 and 12.1).
# 12.3: every M3 Pro (T6030) gets the M3 Pro's Mesa by default: mesa-m3, a
# pacman package with Mesa and the M3 Pro GPU driver in /opt/mesa-m3, never
# over the system Mesa, and a login hook that uses it only on an M3 Pro whose
# GPU is up. It is installed in a pacman transaction of its own after the
# kernel. If it can't be (a package it needs is missing or too old, or pacman
# fails), the kernel install still completes, the summary says so and the
# exit status is 3. Its udev rule gives the GPU's render node to group render,
# so the desktop user goes into that group (from the next login). The summary
# says how to see why the GPU graphics are on or off at a login and how to
# switch them off. --no-m3-mesa leaves it out; --uninstall removes it, and
# takes the user out of render only if this script put them there. M1, M2,
# the M3 Max and the M3 MacBook Air download and install nothing of it.
# Also in 12.3, for every M3: --m3-report writes one bring-up report with the
# host name, user names, serial numbers and MAC addresses masked, including an
# allowlist of the boot loader's device tree (read once through the phram
# driver, which the kernel now builds but never loads at boot);
# --m3-power-survey samples the SMC's temperature and power keys through short
# CPU and backlight loads (opt-in). An M3 that stays kernel-only (the M3 Max,
# and an M3 that is not an Air) ends its install with a NEXT STEPS box. The
# kernel reads the 14-core M3 Max's (t6034) SMC sensors as an M3's.
# 12.4: the M3 MacBook Air (j613, j615) gets mesa-m3 too, the same package and
# asset as the M3 Pro (now built for both GPUs), with its desktop user added to
# group render, recorded and undone as on the M3 Pro. Its login hook leaves the
# Air's GPU off (reason "experimental", software rendering) unless
# /etc/mesa-m3/t8122-gpu-experiment exists, which only --m3-gpu-experiment
# writes (and --uninstall removes). The experiment's own Mesa, mesa-m3-g15g,
# is gone: an Air that has it loses it, recorded, just before mesa-m3 goes on,
# and air-gpu-job.sh runs with /opt/mesa-m3. The hook's reason not-t6030 is now
# not-supported. On the M3 Pro, nothing else changes.
# Also in 12.4: the 13" M3 MacBook Air (j613) gets m1n1's display handoff by
# default (chosen.asahi,t8122-dcp=1 with chosen.asahi,t8122-gpu-handoff-diag=1),
# so the kernel drives its built-in display; an owner's own chosen.<name>=0 line
# in /etc/m1n1.conf switches one off. The j615 stays kernel-only. Every Mac
# moves to m1n1-aurora aurora13: aurora12.1 plus, on a j613 only, a read of the
# GPU's leakage fuses at every boot, logged and published for Linux and used
# only with chosen.asahi,t8122-gpu-fuse-leakage=1 in the GPU experiment. The
# kernel adds the Air's GPU (still only with asahi.t8122_start=1), its display,
# trackpad haptics for every MacBook (the host-driven click off by default),
# and keeps a late USB-C display on the M3 Pro connected while its modes are
# re-described.
# It replaces linux-asahi (or linux-aurora) as a pacman package,
# so mkinitcpio and update-m1n1 run from their own hooks; on a GRUB Mac this
# script regenerates grub.cfg and keeps the previous kernel as a fallback entry.
#
# Touch ID: libfprint with the Apple SEP driver, fprintd, the apple-sep
# service, a sleep hook that stops fprintd before suspend (so a lock screen
# waiting for a finger at lid close can't leave the sensor claimed), and
# this Mac's own sensor calibration. After the reboot, run
# aurora-touchid-setup to enrol a finger and use it for sudo and the lock screen.
#
# m1n1: one m1n1-aurora (M1N1_PACKAGE) for every Mac. It builds
# AsahiLinux/m1n1 main (3e354a24), which knows the macOS 26.5 to 27.0 firmware
# the MacBook Neo ships with, plus Omarchy's patches: the SEP
# warm-registration guard and preboot-UUID forwarding from aurora-silicon/m1n1,
# the usb4-N-pcie-adapter alias fallback (aurora-silicon/m1n1#4), and the M3
# display and GPU handoff, which stays off unless /etc/m1n1.conf arms it.
# From aurora12.1 it also carries the M3 Air GPU handoff's stand-in power
# model, off unless /etc/m1n1.conf arms it too.
# Before boot.bin is rebuilt with it, the boot.bin the Mac booted with is kept
# on the EFI partition (keep_bootbin_on_esp). A MacBook Neo keeps its own m1n1
# unless NEO_AURORA_M1N1 is 1.
# M3: experimental. linux-aurora goes on. On an M3 Pro model in
# M3_HANDOFF_BOARDS (or with --m3-handoff), m1n1-aurora replaces m1n1 and
# three chosen.asahi,t6030-* lines in /etc/m1n1.conf switch its display and
# GPU handoff on. Every other M3 keeps m1n1's boot.bin exactly as it is: no
# m1n1-aurora, no update-m1n1 run, and a freeze on update-m1n1 unless one is
# in place already (see m3_plan). Every M3 Pro and M3 MacBook Air also gets
# mesa-m3 (see the M3's Mesa below, m3_pro_mesa_*).
# On M2 and later the platform hands Linux an already-running Secure
# Enclave, and the driver attaches to it with one registration that can only be
# sent once per boot. Stock m1n1 asks the enclave for randomness on the way up,
# spending that attempt before Linux sees it. aurora-silicon/m1n1 has a guard
# that skips the request when the enclave is already running. On M1, where the
# enclave is still in its boot ROM, the guard never fires.

# (air-display-handoff, aurora8.3 and 8.4) moves to this one only with a new

                       [--session-desktops NAMES] [--list FILE] [--root DIR]

The one definition of "the user's own M3 Mesa setup", used by the mesa-m3
session hook at every login and by the installer. What counts is listed in
--list (default: share/mesa-m3/user-setup.list next to this program's prefix);
see the comments there.

  --home HOME        the user's home ("~" in the list)
  --config-home DIR  the user's XDG_CONFIG_HOME ("{config}"; default HOME/.config)
  --env              also check this process's own environment
  --environ FILE     also check a NUL-separated environment file (such as
                     /proc/PID/environ, which is that process's initial one)
  --session-desktops NAMES
                     the desktop names of the session this is for, ":"-separated
                     as in XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP (uwsm exports them before it reads
                     any environment file); empty or absent: unknown
  --root DIR         prefix every path with DIR (tests)

Nothing is sourced or evaluated. Files are read as text and split into words
the way a POSIX shell would (quotes, backslashes, comments, ";"), with no
expansion except $HOME, ${HOME} and a leading ~ in LD_LIBRARY_PATH entries.

A setting counts as a user setup when it chooses a Mesa outside /opt/mesa-m3:
every component of a list value (":"-separated) must lie in /opt/mesa-m3,
except a reference to the variable's own previous value. A value that cannot
be resolved (another $variable, a command substitution) cannot be cleared and
makes the result "unknown", as does a candidate file or directory that exists
but cannot be read.

Only a setting the session uses counts. Each finding has a scope, the
desktops whose sessions read it (all of them must be among the session's
desktop names, compared with the names lowercased as uwsm does):
  all                 no condition: the environment checked, environment.d,

#
# variable  a path variable that chooses a Mesa. A finding when it is set (in
#           the environment checked, or in one of the files below) and any
#           ":"-separated component lies outside /opt/mesa-m3, or when it is
#           set empty. A reference to its own previous value is allowed.
# flag      a variable that forces a driver choice: a finding when set to any
#           non-empty value.
# prefix    chonkstep's M3 Mesa prefix: a finding unless it is /opt/mesa-m3.
# ldpath    LD_LIBRARY_PATH: a finding for an entry, other than
#           /opt/mesa-m3/lib, that holds libgallium*, libEGL_mesa*,
#           libvulkan_asahi* or a dri/ directory with *_dri.so; and, in a
#           file, for an assignment that replaces it (does not keep
#           $LD_LIBRARY_PATH), since that drops /opt/mesa-m3/lib after the
#           session hook ran. Unrelated entries added to it are no finding.
# envfile   a file that sets session variables, searched for the variables
#           above. Shell, environment.d and /etc/environment lines are split
#           like a POSIX shell (quotes, comments, "export", ";"); Hyprland
#           .conf lines as "env = NAME,VALUE"; Hyprland .lua lines as
#           env("NAME", "VALUE"). "~" is the user's home; a "{config}" path
#           is under XDG_CONFIG_HOME (default ~/.config); "**" matches any
#           depth of subdirectories. envfile: read after the session hook
#           (uwsm env files and Hyprland's own); envfile-before: applied before
#           it (environment.d, /etc/environment, the system uwsm env); and
#           envfile-hookdir: the hook's own directory, where a file sorting
#           after 50-mesa-m3 is read after it. Replacing LD_LIBRARY_PATH counts
#           only after the hook.
# drirc     a drirc file: a finding when it contains a dri_driver option
#           outside XML comments.
# chonkstep chonkstep's M3 session settings: a finding when the file exists and
#           its last CHONKSTEP_M3_MESA_PREFIX names a prefix other than
#           /opt/mesa-m3, or when it sets none (chonkstep's M3 launcher then
#           uses its own default prefix) and the environment checked does not
#           set it to /opt/mesa-m3 either.
# A candidate that exists but cannot be read, or a value that cannot be
# resolved, makes the result "unknown" (never "none").

# The record of this run, on an M3 Pro: $STATE/m3-pro-mesa, one "key=value" per line, for
# --uninstall and the lab check. Read it as data, never source it. The first line is
# schema=aurora.m3-pro-mesa-state/1; a record with another first line is not read. Every key
# appears exactly once, except integration_path, replaced_package, render_added_user,
# user_setup_path, user_setup_ignored, opt_out_path and record_error_key (one line per item,
# each path whole). The keys, in order:
#   schema; run_id (this run's, also in its summary line), release (this script's tag),
#   written_at (UTC, ISO 8601), boot_id, kernel (uname -r) and board (the first device-tree
#   compatible string), all of this run;
#   installer_sha256 and installer_source: the sha256 of the script file this run reads and
#     "file", or "unavailable" and "stdin" when it came through a pipe;
#   package, version, file, sha256 (this release's mesa-m3 entry) and prefix, an
#     integration_path line per file of the package that ties it into the system, and on an Air
#     a replaced_package line ("name version") per earlier Mesa package a run of this script
#     removed for it (mesa-m3-g15g);
#   result (below), installed_version (or none), installed_by (below), preexisting (the mesa-m3
#     version installed before this script first wrote a record on this Mac, or none);
#   user (the invoking user); render_member (yes, no or unknown: in group render, as at the next
#     login), render_preexisting (yes or no: in it before this script first ran; unknown when
#     not known), render_added (yes, no or failed: by this run), render_by_installer (yes when
#     a run of this script added this user and they are still in it), and a render_added_user
#     line per user any run of this script added who is still in it (this one and earlier
#     invoking users): --uninstall takes out only those;
#   user_setup_source (package-detector or installer-builtin: mesa-m3's detector, or this
#     script's byte copy of it), user_setup_session (the session desktops it judged for:
#     M3_PRO_MESA_SESSION_DESKTOPS, lowercased; unknown when no check answered), user_setup
#     (present, none, or unknown when a setting the session uses could not be ruled out or the
#     check failed: from the findings that apply to that session only), a user_setup_path line
#     per place of such a finding, and a user_setup_ignored line ("SCOPE CERTAINTY DETAIL") per
#     finding that session does not use (chonkstep's settings in a Hyprland session, say),
#     listed but never counted; opt_out (present or none), an opt_out_path line per switch-off file and
#     opt_out_cmdline (yes or no); all left as they are;
#   created_files: 0, as the package owns every file.
# result, what this run did:
#   installed     this run installed the package (none was installed, or an older one)
#   current       the same version was installed already: nothing new was installed
#   newer-kept    a newer mesa-m3 was installed, and was kept
#   skipped-flag  --no-m3-mesa: left out; one installed earlier stays
#   skipped-deps  a package it needs is missing or too old: left out (exit status 3)
#   failed        its pacman -U failed, or its file holds another package (exit status 3)
#   record-error  this run could not write its record (an error record, below)
# installed_by, who put the installed mesa-m3 there:
#   installer     this script's pacman -U. Set by a run that installs it, and kept by later runs
#                 while the same version stays installed.
#   owner         anyone else: installed before this script first ran, or replaced or
#                 installed outside it since (another version than the record's).
#   none          no mesa-m3 is installed.
# When a value holds a newline or a carriage return, or the write fails before its rename, the
# previous run's record must not look current: an error record replaces it (schema, the run's
# keys from run_id to installer_source, package, result=record-error, record_error (value or
# write), a record_error_key line per refused key, never its value, and installed_version,
# installed_by, preexisting, render_user (the user, or none when refused), render_preexisting,
# render_by_installer and the render_added_user lines, which keep the ownership history). If that write fails too, the
# previous record is moved aside to m3-pro-mesa.stale-<its written_at> (never over another file),
# so no record is current. Every failure is in the one warning, and the exit status is 4.
# --uninstall removes mesa-m3 only when installed_by is installer, the installed version is the
# record's, preexisting is none, and result is not record-error; and takes a user out of group
# render only when a render_added_user line names them, they are still in it, and result is not
# record-error. The lab's positive check:
# result installed or current, installed_by installer, installed_version the pinned version,
# sha256 the pinned package's sha256, and run_id the one in the summary line of the installer
# run under test. The record says what this script did, not what renders.

   If the desktop does not come up: Ctrl+Alt+F3, log in, run
     mkdir -p ~/.config/mesa-m3 && touch ~/.config/mesa-m3/disable
   and reboot, or add mesa_m3=off to the kernel command line at the boot menu. To turn it
   back on: rm ~/.config/mesa-m3/disable and log in again.
   If a login with GPU graphics did not reach a working desktop, the next logins of that
   boot render in software (previous-failed). To try the GPU again:
     rm ~/.local/state/mesa-m3/attempt

agent_prompt() {
  cat <<'PROMPT'
You are testing an experimental Secure Enclave / Touch ID kernel on an Apple
Silicon Mac. Work through this in order and report at the end. Do not skip the
identification step: nearly every past report was unusable because the machine
was not pinned down.

SAFETY, NON-NEGOTIABLE
  - This touches the Secure Enclave. Confirm the owner can DFU-restore this Mac
    before you start.
  - A default install is NOT read-only. On the first boot of a Mac with a
    Touch ID profile, the SEP driver loads automatically, creates an identity
    keybag and writes to the enclave's anti-replay store (xART) -- before
    anyone enrols a finger. If the owner cannot DFU-restore, install with
    --read-only instead, before the first reboot:
      curl -fsSL https://github.com/omacom/linux-aurora/releases/latest/download/install-aurora-sep.sh | bash -s -- --read-only
    A 'blacklist apple_sep' line does not prevent this on its own; the
    installer detects one and leaves the driver off.
  - Do not run any enrol/delete/re-provision loop unless the owner asks for
    it in writing: repeated cycles drift a device-wide counter.
  - Do not paste key material, serial numbers, or the contents of
    mesa_calibration.bin into a report.
  - The install replaces the Mac's boot loader (m1n1), on every Mac but an
    M3 that stays kernel-only and a MacBook Neo. Before it does, it keeps
    the old one on the EFI partition and prints the steps to put it back:
    keep them, they name this Mac's EFI partition.

IF THE MAC STOPS IN m1n1 AFTER AN INSTALL (any Mac)
  m1n1 text on screen and no boot menu, or a black screen for more than two
  minutes: the owner puts the old boot.bin back from macOS with the printed
  steps, starts Linux, and runs the two printed lines. The first keeps
  updates from rebuilding the new boot loader; the second records that its
  m1n1 failed on this Mac. Later plain runs of the one-liner then keep the
  boot loader the Mac has and install the rest, and never put that m1n1
  back. If it boots but something is wrong, the same copy goes back from
  Linux with the printed line, followed by the same two lines. Do not use
  --uninstall until the maintainer says so. Report what the screen showed
  and when, with the serial log if there is one, at
  https://github.com/iconidentify/aurora-linux/issues/6

ON AN M3 (M3, M3 Pro, M3 Max): Touch ID is not supported there yet. Do steps
0 and 1, then go to step 11, which says what should happen on your model and
how to get it added. Steps 6, 7 and 9 apply as well, and step 8 without the
fingerprint.

0. CONFIRM YOU HAVE THE CURRENT BUILD
   Results against a superseded build waste everyone's time, and a saved copy
   of this script installs its own packages forever. This script checks on
   every install and prints either "<tag> is the current release" or a warning
   naming the newer one. To check without installing:

     curl -fsSL https://api.github.com/repos/omacom/linux-aurora/releases/latest \
       | grep -m1 '"tag_name"' 

   Always fetch the script from the "latest" URL rather than a tag you were
   handed, so you get the current one automatically:

     curl -fsSL https://github.com/omacom/linux-aurora/releases/latest/download/install-aurora-sep.sh | bash

   State the tag you installed in your report. If you were given a specific
   older tag on purpose, say so and say why.

1. IDENTIFY THE MACHINE
     tr -d '\0' < /proc/device-tree/compatible; echo
     for p in os-fw-version system-fw-version iboot2-version; do
       printf '%s = ' "$p"
       tr -d '\0' < /proc/device-tree/chosen/asahi,$p 2>/dev/null; echo
     done
     uname -r; pacman -Q linux-aurora m1n1-aurora libfprint aurora-touchid
   asahi,system-fw-version is the sepOS the enclave actually runs and is the
   single most useful line in the whole report. asahi,os-fw-version is only the
   stub. Report both; they are often different.

2. CONFIRM THE BOOTLOADER GUARD (M2 and later)
   In the m1n1 stage 2 boot log, expect:
     SEP: Preserving iBoot warm registration; seeding RNG from ADT
   and expect NO line reading "SEP: couldn't get enough random bytes".
   You should also see the OS identity forwarded:
     FDT: apfs-preboot-uuid = '<uuid>'
   On M1 neither line is expected: the enclave is cold and m1n1 talks to it
   normally. If you see the "couldn't get enough random bytes" line on any
   machine, the stock m1n1 is still in boot.bin - say so and stop, because every
   later result is then measuring the wrong thing.
   On an M3 installed kernel-only (step 11), the boot loader is the one the Mac
   already had, so this step does not apply: say "M3, kernel-only" instead.

3. DRIVER ATTACH
   The driver is already loaded at boot by apple-sep.service; do not reload
   it. Its write mode was fixed at install time. Read what it did:
     sudo dmesg | grep -iE 'apple_sep|apple-mesa'
   The xART line ends "writes ENABLED" or "writes disabled" -- quote it, and
   say which you expected.
   PASS:  "attach: N endpoints advertised in M messages" with N >= 7, and
          /dev/sep-bio exists.
   FAIL:  "attach: 0 messages received but no endpoint advertised", or no
          apple_sep lines at all. Capture the whole block either way.
   If the profile line says a SoC you did not expect, report that verbatim.
   On every MacBook Pro M2 Pro/Max (J414s, J414c, J416s, J416c) it reads
   "T6020/J414s", or "T6020/J414s (13.5 key store)" on system firmware 26.2
   or earlier; on the MacBook Pro 14"/16" M1 Max (J314c, J316c)
   "T6000/J316s", and on the MacBook Air 13" M2 (J413) "T8112/J415". Those
   are expected. On an M2 Pro/Max, also quote the line that starts
   "M2 Pro/Max on system firmware".
   If "CREATE_KEYBAG" fails with status -13, quote that line too. Firmware
   up to 26.2 uses the 13.5 key store and later firmware variant 5. Variant
   5 works on 26.6.x and 27.0; 26.3 to 26.5 have not been tried, so a -13
   there is the report we need.
   Updating macOS from 26.2 or earlier to a later release after enrolling
   loses the enrolments: Touch ID then needs a new keybag. Say so if that
   is what happened. With the owner's agreement, start Touch ID over:
     curl -fsSL https://github.com/omacom/linux-aurora/releases/latest/download/install-aurora-sep.sh | bash -s -- --reset-touchid
   then reboot and enrol again.
   The sensor itself: "sudo dmesg | grep apple-mesa" should say the power line
   came "from the device node". Quote it if it says anything else.

4. IF ATTACH FAILED, GET THE MAILBOX STATE
     sudo busybox devmem 0x396408110 32   # A2I control (t600x/t602x)
     sudo busybox devmem 0x396408114 32   # I2A control
     grep -i mbox /proc/interrupts
   Those addresses are for t600x and t602x. The mailbox base differs per SoC,
   so take it from the device tree rather than a table:

     sudo cat /proc/device-tree/soc/mbox@*/reg 2>/dev/null | xxd | head -2
     # or read the sep_mbox node address from your board's dtsi:
     #   t8103            0x242408000  -> 0x242408110 / 0x242408114
     #   t8112            0x25e408000  -> 0x25e408110 / 0x25e408114
     #   t600x, t602x     0x396408000  -> 0x396408110 / 0x396408114
     #   t8140 (Neo)      0x282608000  (a v4 mailbox: report the base and
     #                    the /proc/interrupts lines, not these offsets)

   Bit 0 is the enable; a non-zero FIFO count with an unchanged read pointer
   means the enclave never took the message. Report the raw values, not your
   reading of them.

5. TOUCH ID END TO END (only if step 3 passed)
     aurora-touchid-setup
   Enrol one finger, then:
     fprintd-verify
   Then REBOOT and run fprintd-verify again without re-enrolling. Matching
   right after enrolment and matching after a reboot are different paths (the
   second restores the enrolment from disk), so report them separately.
   If a verify fails, the driver logs the step that ended it:
     sudo dmesg | grep -E 'verify:|scrd:|Touch ID|catacomb|matching unavailable'
   fprintd's "verify-unknown-error" is not a result on its own; quote those
   lines with it.
   Then check the consumers the owner actually cares about: sudo, polkit, and
   the lock screen. Report each as pass/fail separately - partial success here
   is the normal outcome and is worth knowing precisely.

6. THUNDERBOLT AND DISPLAYPORT - TEST THIS EVEN IF YOU CAME FOR TOUCH ID
   This build carries the Thunderbolt/USB4 display and PCIe work, and it needs
   hardware reports as much as the enclave does. Do not skip it because the
   machine has no dock: "no dock available" is itself a useful answer, and
   step 6a still applies.

   6a. The controllers (no dock needed)
         ls /sys/bus/platform/devices/ | grep cio
         sudo dmesg | grep -iE 'thunderbolt|usb4|acio|tunnel' | head -30
       Expect one *.cio device per controller, bound to thunderbolt-apple-acio.
       An EMPTY /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/ with nothing plugged in is
       normal: routers only appear when a device is attached. Do not report
       that as a failure.
       Anything behind a Thunderbolt 3 dock's PCIe controller -- Ethernet,
       storage, and on docks such as the CalDigit TS3 Plus the USB ports too --
       now comes up on M1, M1 Pro/Max and M2 Pro/Max. On the Pro/Max chips the
       kernel starts the tunnel itself when a dock is plugged in, and logs
         port ... cold init done, status 0x3 ...
       (pcie_apple.tunnel_kernel_init=0 turns that off). Displays, and USB on
       USB4 docks, do not need the PCIe tunnel. On the M2 MacBook Air/Pro 13"
       and on M3 the tunnel isn't supported yet, so this line is normal there:
         PCIe-C tunnel disabled: not initialized by m1n1 or the kernel
       Report it if you see it on an M1, M1 Pro/Max or M2 Pro/Max.

   6b. With a dock or a DisplayPort monitor, in this order:
         - attached at boot: does the display come up, and at what resolution
           and refresh rate
         - hot unplug: does the tunnel tear down cleanly, no hang, no stuck
           compositor
         - hot replug: does the display come back, same mode as before
         - repeat both of the above on the SECOND USB-C port, not just the
           first: the ports are separate controllers and have behaved
           differently
         - two displays or a dual-output dock, if you have one
         - M2 Pro/Max: two monitors plugged straight into two USB-C ports
           (no dock), attached at boot. Does each come up at its own native
           resolution? Quote "hyprctl monitors" (name, mode, and the port each
           is on). Then log out and back in, and repeat.
         - PCIe behind the dock: Ethernet, USB storage, card readers, and a
           keyboard and mouse on the dock's USB ports. Do they all work, and
           still work after a replug? Quote:
             lspci -nn
             sudo dmesg | grep -E 'cold init done|link up after|translation fault|HC died'
           Any "translation fault" or "HC died" line is a failure to report.
           For a full report, after plugging the dock in:
             curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iconidentify/aurora-linux/refs/tags/sep-7.1.12.aurora2-11.110-test/tools/aurora-tb/tb-pcie-report
             sudo sh tb-pcie-report --no-wait

   6c. Across suspend:
         systemctl suspend
       Then wake and re-check: display back, dock devices back, and
       /dev/sep-bio still present. Report anything that needed a replug to
       recover.

7. HARDWARE VIDEO DECODE
   Play an H.264 file and an HEVC file and confirm it is not silently falling
   back to software:
     sudo dmesg | grep -iE 'avd|apple-vpu' | tail -20
   Report which codecs you exercised and at what resolution.

8. ONE SUSPEND/RESUME CYCLE AT THE END
   Ask the owner to lock the screen and, while it waits for a fingerprint,
   close the lid. Then open it and unlock with the finger. Report whether
   the Mac woke and whether the finger unlocked it, and quote:
     sudo dmesg | grep -E 'Touch ID: ending|still running|PM: suspend'
   Re-check /dev/sep-bio, the display and the dock after resume.

9. NEURAL ENGINE
   This build carries the in-tree Apple Neural Engine driver
   (aurora-silicon/linux#155), switched on for the M1, M1 Pro, M1 Max, M2 Pro
   and M2 Max. On every other Mac no Neural Engine lines are expected, and that
   is a pass. The ANE now powers off about 1.5 s after its last use:
     cat /sys/bus/platform/drivers/ane*/*.ane/power/runtime_status
   should read "suspended" while nothing uses it (M1 family).
     pacman -Q omarchy-ane-dkms 2>/dev/null   # if installed, say so: its modules replace this kernel's
     modinfo -F filename ane ane_t6021
     ls -l /dev/accel/ 2>/dev/null
     sudo dmesg | grep -iE '\bane\b|ane_t6021|neural' | head -40
   M1, M1 Pro, M1 Max PASS: the ane module is bound, /dev/accel/accel0 exists,
   and the module path is under kernel/drivers/accel/ane (not updates/dkms).
   M2 Pro, M2 Max: without the Neural Engine firmware, expect a firmware load
   error and nothing else broken. With it (fetched by Joshua Warren's
   omarchy-ane-firmware-fetch), expect ane_t6021 bound and /dev/accel/accel0.
   The M2 Pro has not run it before this build: report it either way.
   If omarchy-ane's tools are installed, also run omarchy-ane-check, and on an
   M2 Pro/Max omarchy-ane-check --smoke; quote their result lines.
   Report any kernel log line at emergency or alert level, and whether idle
   battery drain changed against the previous build. If the Mac does not finish
   booting, add module_blacklist=ane,ane_t6021 to the kernel command line from
   the boot menu, and report that.

10. MACBOOK NEO (J700) ONLY
   The Neo's Wi-Fi is in the regular kernel now. It needs this Neo's own
   firmware, calibration and country files; the installer listed any that
   were missing. Never install another Neo's files.
     sudo dmesg | grep -iE 'mt7932|piodma|REGULATORY|CALIBRATION|admission'
     iw reg get | head -3
     nmcli device wifi list | head
   - Without the country file, expect
       REGULATORY_BLOCKED: <CC> generation=N error=-2 recovery-required=0
     and nothing else broken; quote it. After installing that file, retry a
     scan (nmcli device wifi rescan): it should come up without a reboot.
   - With every file present: does it scan, connect to a WPA2 network and
     pass traffic? Try a 2.4 GHz network and a 5 GHz one on channels 36-48.
     Networks on channels 149-165 are not listed, by design.
   - systemctl suspend is refused by design while the radios are active.
     Expect "sleep refused: Neo radio bootstrap retains DMA memory until full
     hardware reset" and quote it.
   - Bluetooth is off by default. Only test it if the owner asks (see
     Documentation/networking/device_drivers/wifi/mt7932-neo.rst).

   Report "not tested" honestly rather than guessing, for any of the above.

11. M3 MACS (M3, M3 PRO, M3 MAX): WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN, AND HOW YOURS GETS ADDED
   Every M3 is experimental, and every M3 report moves M3 support forward.
   Touch ID is not supported on M3 yet: skip steps 2 to 5 and the fingerprint
   part of step 8, and expect
   "apple_sep: no platform profile for this SoC; the SEP stays disabled".
   First find the model and chip, then follow the matching case below:
     tr '\0' '\n' < /proc/device-tree/compatible | head -2
     cat /var/lib/aurora-sep/m3-mode     # after an install: kernel or handoff
     cat /var/lib/aurora-sep/m3-pro-mesa # M3 Pro: what happened to its Mesa
   On an M3 MacBook Air, follow case D.

   A. apple,j516s + apple,t6030 (MacBook Pro 16" M3 Pro): SUPPORTED, handoff on.
      The plain one-liner installs the kernel and replaces m1n1 with one
      that hands the built-in display and the GPU over to Linux. While it
      runs it prints:
        M3 Pro (j516s, macOS 14.8.3 stub): installing m1n1 with the display and GPU handoff
      then the macOS steps to put the old boot loader back (it is kept as
      m1n1/boot.bin.before-<version> on the EFI partition), and at the end:
        m1n1's boot.bin is this release's m1n1 with the M3 Pro handoff switches
      Every M3 Pro also gets the M3 Pro's Mesa (mesa-m3, in /opt/mesa-m3),
      installed on its own after the kernel, and the desktop user goes into
      the render group, which the GPU now needs. The summary says:
        The M3 Pro's Mesa (mesa-m3 <version>, in /opt/mesa-m3) is installed.
        Added <user> to the render group, ... (unless already a member)
      If it says "The M3 Pro's Mesa was NOT installed" instead (exit status
      3), quote the warning above it: the kernel install is complete, and the
      desktop renders in software until a rerun installs it. (--no-m3-mesa
      leaves the Mesa out; only use it if the owner asks.)
      Reboot with the owner watching. Expected within about a minute: the
      Omarchy logo, the boot menu, then the desktop on the built-in display
      at 3456x2234, GPU accelerated. After login, quote
        cat /run/user/$(id -u)/mesa-m3-session.state
      (the Mesa's login check: decision=active, or the reason it stayed off,
      such as user-setup when the owner has a Mesa of their own). Then run
      the checks below and report.
      External displays: try each USB-C port and the HDMI port, one at a
      time and then HDMI with one USB-C display, and say which port, which
      display and which mode lit. Sleep has known limits on M3; if you try
      it with an external display attached, quote what happened.
      If it STOPS (m1n1 text and no boot menu, or a black screen for more
      than two minutes), follow "IF THE MAC STOPS IN m1n1" above. If it
      boots but the display or the GPU is WRONG, collect
        sudo journalctl -b -k | grep -iE 'dcp|asahi|t6030|m1n1'
      first, then follow the same section from Linux.

   B. any other apple,t6030 model (MacBook Pro 14" M3 Pro, J514S): NOT ON
      THE LIST YET. A REPORT FROM YOU IS HOW IT GETS ADDED.
      The plain one-liner installs the kernel only (boot.bin untouched, boot
      framebuffer) and says so:
        M3 Pro (j514s): installing the kernel only, and boot.bin stays as it is.
      It installs the M3 Pro's Mesa as in case A, and the summary says that
      without the handoff it stays off at login (software rendering).
      Run the checks below on that first; it is a useful report on its own.
      Then, to try the display and GPU handoff on this model:
        - Only with the owner's explicit agreement, with the owner at the
          Mac for the first boot, and only if the owner can start macOS on
          this Mac (hold the power button at startup). If the new boot
          loader does not start, macOS on the same Mac is the only way back.
        - The installer itself refuses unless the Mac has the macOS 14.8.3
          system-firmware stub that the Omarchy installer gives every M3.
        - Run:
            curl -fsSL https://github.com/omacom/linux-aurora/releases/latest/download/install-aurora-sep.sh | bash -s -- --m3-handoff
          Keep the restore steps it prints (they name this Mac's EFI
          partition). It must end with "m1n1's boot.bin is this release's
          m1n1 with the M3 Pro handoff switches"; if it stops with an error
          instead, nothing was changed: report the error.
        - Reboot, with the owner watching. Then report exactly one of:
          * WORKS: the desktop on the built-in display at native resolution.
            Give the checks below, and again after one suspend/resume. Title
            it "<board> (<model>): M3 handoff works". This report is what
            adds the model to the list in the next release; until then a
            plain re-run of the one-liner keeps the handoff on this Mac.
            A release with a newer m1n1 asks again: its plain run stops
            with "run this again with --m3-handoff" and changes nothing.
          * STOPS: m1n1 text and no boot menu, or a black screen for more than
            two minutes. Follow "IF THE MAC STOPS IN m1n1" above, and report
            what the screen showed and when.
          * WRONG: it boots, but the display or the GPU is wrong. Collect
              sudo journalctl -b -k | grep -iE 'dcp|asahi|t6030|m1n1'
            over SSH if you can, then follow the same section from Linux,
            reboot, and report.

   C. apple,t8122 other than the MacBook Air (MacBook Pro 14" M3, J504;
      iMac M3, J433/J434) or apple,t6031 / apple,t6034 (M3 Max): KERNEL
      ONLY for now.
      m1n1 has no display and GPU handoff for these Macs yet, and
      --m3-handoff refuses here. The one-liner installs the kernel only and
      leaves boot.bin as it is. Expected: the desktop on the boot framebuffer
      (one fixed resolution, software rendering). Report what works and
      what does not: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, keyboard, trackpad, audio, USB and
      Thunderbolt, suspend/resume, battery. These reports decide which chip
      gets the handoff next.
      The install ends with a NEXT STEPS block. After the reboot, check that
      "uname -r" names this release's kernel, then run the one-liner with
      --m3-report ("bash -s -- --m3-report"). It only reads, and writes one
      file in the current directory, aurora-m3-report-<board>-<date>.tgz,
      with the host name, user names, serial numbers and MAC addresses
      masked; a file that still has any is not kept. On an M3 it also
      loads the phram module for a moment, to read the boot loader's copy
      of the ADT through a read-only node, and unloads it again (one it
      did not load stays as it is). Attach the file to the issue.
      Only when the maintainer asks: --m3-power-survey (about five minutes,
      needs sudo) runs short CPU and backlight loads while it samples the
      SMC's temperature and power keys, stops early if a CPU or SoC die
      key reads 100 C, puts everything back, and writes
      aurora-m3-power-<board>-<date>.tgz.

   D. apple,j613 or apple,j615 + apple,t8122 (MacBook Air 13" or 15" M3):
      A plain J613 install keeps the ordinary display handoff and GPU
      activation policy. A plain J615 install keeps the kernel-only path;
      --m3-handoff remains its optional display/diagnostic handoff.
      A new matched bundle supports current14 GPU acceleration on both
      J613 and J615; older bundles remain J613-only.

      Experimental Air acceleration with the matched installer:
      To select the supported profile from this boot's GPU firmware:
        bash install-aurora-sep.sh --m3-gpu
      This is an explicit persistent opt-in. A diagnostics-only current14
      boot may omit the GPU descriptor; the exact stub/iBoot checks still
      apply. The system-firmware version never selects the GPU profile.
      For the command, prerequisites and recovery steps, see M3-GPU.md.
      Current14 and exact25G83 are separate profiles. On a supported Air
      already using current14 firmware, run the matched installer:
        bash install-aurora-sep.sh --m3-gpu-persistent
      This installs the matching kernel, Mesa and unified bootloader
      together, retains a reachable GPU-off previous entry, and selects
      the experimental GPU for subsequent boots. It does not require a
      firmware migration or a separate one-shot arming command. After
      reboot and normal desktop login, run:
        aurora-m3-gpu-check
      It checks actual Apple GPU OpenGL/Vulkan readback, not just packages.
      Native25 is qualified on J613. On a J613 already booted from its own exact26.6.2/25G83 volume group,
      with the source-qualified stage1 named by the matched installer:
        bash install-aurora-sep.sh --m3-profile=j613-25g83
      This selects native experimental OpenGL under /opt/mesa-m3/25g83;
      hardware Vulkan is unavailable. The installed selector is
      /etc/mesa-m3/t8122-profile=j613-25g83-hal200. Firmware and loaded
      GPU identity checks must pass. Linux14 cannot select this profile;
      neither command migrates stage1 or macOS firmware.
      J615 on 26.6.2 is EXPERIMENTAL and has not been booted on a J615.
      It needs a J615 booted from its own 26.6.2 volume group with the
      J615-capable stage1 v1.6.1-m3air25.stage1, and a matched installer
      whose release lists j615 for 25G83. Then:
        bash install-aurora-sep.sh --m3-profile=j615-25g83
      It is the same 25G83 profile plus m1n1's
      chosen.asahi,j615-25g83-experimental=1 switch; --m3-gpu and
      --m3-profile=j613-25g83 never select it on a J615. Any identity
      mismatch leaves the GPU off on the boot framebuffer. Send
      aurora-m3-gpu-check --details and --m3-report output either way.
      A refusal leaves activation unchanged. If installation fails,
      use 'Aurora previous (GPU off)' in Limine, or the retained previous
      kernel in GRUB. Quote the failure and keep the boot report.
      If it stops before the menu, follow "IF THE MAC STOPS IN m1n1" above.
      Plain later installs preserve the selected persistent profile.
      Every Air also gets mesa-m3 under /opt/mesa-m3. Ordinary J613/J615
      installs retain their existing activation behavior. The optional
      --m3-gpu-experiment installs air-gpu-oneshot.sh, air-gpu-collect.sh
      and air-gpu-job.sh for a single-boot experiment; it arms nothing
      by itself. It is separate from the persistent matched profiles.
      For that optional one-shot path, the first arming is
        sudo air-gpu-oneshot.sh t8122_pstate_cap=1
      In the armed boot, --status must say "ubootefi.var: does not name
      air-gpu-oneshot" before another knob is tried. This clearing behavior
      has been tested on an M3 Pro only.
      After the first accelerated boot, run --m3-report and record
      /run/user/$(id -u)/mesa-m3-session.state and the kernel GPU log.

   Checks for every M3 (quote the output; on a kernel-only M3 the handoff
   lines are expected to be missing, so say so):
     tr -d '\0' < /proc/device-tree/chosen/asahi,m1n1-stage2-version; echo
     ls /proc/device-tree/soc/dcp@*/apple,t6030-handoff 2>&1
     for c in /sys/class/drm/card*-*; do [ -e "$c/status" ] && echo "$c $(cat "$c/status") $(head -1 "$c/modes")"; done
     sudo dmesg | grep -E 't6030-display|\[drm\] Initialized|GPU firmware|aop.*crash|apple_sep' | head -12
     nproc
     ls /proc/device-tree/soc/usb4-pcie-tunnel-0/pcie@730000000/pci@0,0/apple,tunable 2>&1
     ls /proc/device-tree/chosen/asahi,m1n1-oslog-overlap 2>&1
     ls -d /proc/device-tree/reserved-memory/dcp-oslog@* 2>&1
   With the handoff, the first of those two must say "No such file or
   directory": if the node exists, report that before anything else. The
   second lists three dcp-oslog nodes on an M3 Pro and one on an Air.
   In the report header, set **M3 path:** to kernel, handoff, or handoff
   with --m3-handoff.

HOW TO REPORT
  Open one issue per Mac at https://github.com/omacom/linux-aurora/issues
  (not on omacom/linux#7 any more), with the first line of the report as its
  title. Post later results for the same Mac as comments on that issue.
  Structure it exactly like this:

    # <board> (<marketing name>): <one-line outcome>
    **Machine:** apple,jXXX / apple,tXXXX, <model>
    **Firmware:** asahi,os-fw-version = X, asahi,system-fw-version = Y
    **Build:** <release tag>, linux-aurora <ver>, m1n1-aurora <ver>
    **m1n1 guard:** fired / did not fire / stock m1n1 still installed
    **Touch ID:** enrol <pass/fail>, verify <pass/fail>, verify after reboot <pass/fail>
    **Thunderbolt:** <dock model, or "no dock"> on port <1 / 2 / both>
    **M3 path:** not an M3 / kernel / handoff / handoff with --m3-handoff

    ## What worked
    ## What did not
    ## Logs
    (fenced blocks, trimmed to the relevant lines - never a whole dmesg)

  Rules for the write-up:
    - Lead with the outcome, not the narrative.
    - Quote log lines exactly; do not paraphrase an error.
    - Say explicitly what you did NOT test. "No dock available" and "only
      tested port 1" are useful answers; silence is not.
    - Name the dock and the display mode. "CalDigit TS3 Plus, 3840x2160 @ 60"
      is actionable; "external display worked" is not.
    - If something failed, give the last known-good state and the first bad one.
    - Do not claim a fix works because it compiled or because the module
      loaded. Only step 3's endpoint line and step 5's verify-match count.

# ---- the M3 Max test kit (--m3max-kit) -----------------------------------------------------------
# One command runs the M3 Max test plan (T1 to T4 of the J516C ADT review) on a 16-core M3 Max
# (t6031: J514C, J516C), so the tester runs it once and uploads one file. --m3max-kit:
#   1. checks this Mac (chip and board, the Limine boot menu, the one-shot boot variables, disk
#      space) and downloads and checks the kit's files, before anything changes;
#   2. shows one consent screen (or takes --yes);
#   3. writes the baseline report (stage 00-baseline, the --m3-report collection);
#   4. installs this release's kernel and the M3 Max boot loader variant (--m3-handoff), keeping
#      the boot.bin the Mac booted with on the EFI partition (with the restore steps) and the
#      kernel it runs as a boot menu entry ("Aurora previous (GPU off)"), plus the kit's
#      separate-prefix Mesa when the release has one (M3MAX_KIT_MESA_PACKAGE);
#   5. installs the runner, aurora-m3max-kit (this script, run with --m3max-kit-runner), and two
#      systemd units, and restarts the Mac.
# From then on the runner works at every boot (aurora-m3max-kit.service): it collects what this
# boot shows into the stage's directory, then arms the plan's next boot as ONE Limine one-shot
# boot (air-gpu-oneshot.sh's LoaderEntryOneShot mechanism, with its locks and checks) and
# restarts the Mac after a short delay. A one-shot boot is used once: Limine deletes the
# variable before the kernel starts, so a hang, a panic (panic=10) or a power cycle always lands
# on the normal entry. A stage whose boot left no collection is recorded as hung at the next boot
# (hung when it reached userspace, aurora-m3max-kit-mark.service's marker; hung-early when it did
# not), with that boot's journal, and the kit goes on. The plan (M3MAX_KIT_PLAN, a release
# asset; m3max_kit_plan_check says what it holds) names every boot and its kernel parameters, so
# its knob sets change without a code change. The kit arms at most the plan's max-boots
# experimental boots (never more than M3MAX_KIT_BOOT_CEILING). It ends on a normal boot: it
# collects that boot too, packs every stage into one tgz in the desktop user's home, masked and
# checked as --m3-report's is, and says which file to upload. "sudo aurora-m3max-kit --status",
# "--stop" and "--restore" work at any point; --restore puts back the boot.bin the Mac booted with
# (and the kernel-only state around it) and keeps the previous kernel's boot menu entry.

M3 Max test kit: how to undo it ($(date -u +%Y-%m-%d), $TAG)

From Linux, at any time (stops the kit, puts back the boot loader this Mac had):
  sudo aurora-m3max-kit --restore

If the Mac stops in the boot loader (m1n1 text on screen, often "No valid payload found", and no
boot menu), put the boot loader back from macOS:
  1. Hold the power button until the Mac turns off, then press and hold it again for the
     startup options, and start macOS (or Options, then Utilities > Terminal).
  2. In Terminal, run: diskutil list
     Find the partition whose UUID is $uuid (any case) with:
       diskutil info diskNsM | grep -i 'partition uuid'
  3. sudo diskutil mount diskNsM   (it prints the /Volumes path)
  4. cp -X '<that path>/m1n1/boot.bin.before-$VERSION' '<that path>/m1n1/boot.bin'
  Then start Linux and run: sudo aurora-m3max-kit --restore

After the boot loader is put back, start Linux: the kit sees it, records that boot as hung,
puts this Mac back as it was before the kit, and finishes by itself; then run
sudo aurora-m3max-kit --status for the file to upload. If Linux does not come back at all, the
results up to the boot loader test are on the same partition as
m1n1/aurora-m3max-kit-interim.tgz (copy it off from macOS and upload it).

If a test boot freezes or the screen stays black for more than 5 minutes: hold the power
button until the Mac turns off, then press it again. The next boot is always the normal one,
and the kit records that test boot as hung and goes on by itself. This is true of every test
boot but one: the boot loader GPU test changes boot.bin, so if the Mac does not come back from
it, put the boot loader back from macOS as above.

If the normal boot itself fails, pick "Aurora previous (GPU off)" in the boot menu: the kernel
this Mac ran before the kit. The kept boot loader is $keep.

======================== M3 MAX TEST KIT ($(this_board)) ========================
This runs the M3 Max test plan on this Mac in one go. It:
  1. writes a report of this Mac as it is now (it only reads);
  2. installs the test kernel ($(m3_kernel_release)) and a new boot loader: m1n1-aurora
     $(m1n1_version) with the M3 Max boot loader variant ($M3_MAX_VARIANT). The boot loader this
     Mac has now is kept on the EFI partition, and the kernel it runs now stays in the boot
     menu as "Aurora previous (GPU off)";
  3. restarts the Mac by itself up to $restarts times, over about $minutes minutes. The test boots
     are used once: whatever happens in one, the next restart is your normal boot. Save your
     work, keep the Mac on power, and let it run; nothing needs to be typed. Each restart is
     announced a minute or so ahead.
     If a test boot freezes or the screen stays black for more than 5 minutes, hold the power
     button until the Mac turns off, then press it again: the kit notes that boot and goes on.
     One step is different: the boot loader GPU test changes boot.bin itself. Before it, the
     kit writes the results so far (a file you can upload on its own) and announces it 3
     minutes ahead. If the Mac does not come back from it, put the boot loader back from macOS
     (the steps below); the kit then finishes by itself at the next Linux start.
  4. at the end, writes one file in your home folder, aurora-m3max-kit-$(this_board)-<date>.tgz,
     with the host name, user names, serial numbers and MAC addresses masked. You upload it.
At any time:
  sudo aurora-m3max-kit --status    what it has done, and what comes next
  sudo aurora-m3max-kit --stop      arm nothing more (keeps the results so far)
  sudo aurora-m3max-kit --restore   stop, and put back the boot loader this Mac has now
The steps to put the boot loader back from macOS are printed below and saved in your home
folder as aurora-m3max-kit-RESTORE.txt.
