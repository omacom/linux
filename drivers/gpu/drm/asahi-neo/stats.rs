//! Snapshot of AGX firmware statistics.
//!
//! [`StatsSnapshot`] accumulates the values decoded by `StatsChannel::poll`
//! (see `fw::channels.rs::StatsMsg`) and exposes them to the sysfs file
//! `agx_stats` (registered from `sysfs.c`).
//!
//! The snapshot belongs to one GPU manager. The firmware-stat
//! decoder that feeds it lives in `StatsChannel::poll` (`channel.rs`), inside
//! the versioned context where `StatsMsg` is nameable; `note_job()` is called
//! from the `recv_message` rtkit callback (so the firmware mailbox IRQ
//! context); the sysfs `show` callback runs in arbitrary process context. All
//! fields use `AtomicU*` so neither side takes a lock.
//!
//! Field semantics (firmware units, late-validated):
//! - `util1..util4`: raw `Utilization` u32s from the firmware. Meaning
//!   (firmware tick or %?) is validated against a controlled MLX load; we
//!   publish them unscaled per the producer contract.
//! - `pstate`: current performance state index from `PowerState`.
//! - `avg_power_mw`: average power in milliwatts from `AvgPower` (firmware
//!   field is u32 — units not validated for every chip rev; treat as raw).
//! - `temperature`: raw `Temperature` value, scale, tmin, tmax.
//! - `busy_ns`: cumulative utilization-weighted busy time in nanoseconds,
//!   derived from successive `Utilization` windows (busiest subqueue
//!   percentage x window duration; the firmware timestamps are base-clock
//!   ticks, 24 MHz, converted with `HwConfig::base_clock_hz`). Monotonic and
//!   bounded by elapsed time. Saturates at u64::MAX.
//! - `jobs`: completed submissions since boot, counted at submission
//!   completion (`JobFence::command_complete`).
//!
//! This module is read-only with respect to scheduling or power behaviour:
//! the firmware already sends the messages, the channel already polls them,
//! we only retain the latest values.
